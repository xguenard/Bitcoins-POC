How to build a p2p applications. 

- Connectivity: how to find and connect other P2P nodes that are running 
in the network (unlike traditional servers, they don't have a fixed
, known IP address)

-Instability: nodes may always be joining and leaving the network (unlike servers
 web, email, etc., which we usually depend on to "be there")

-Message routing: how messages should be routed to get from one node to another 
(where the two nodes may not directly know about each other)

-Searching (somewhat related to routing): how to find desired information 
from the nodes connected to the network

Security: a whole slew of issues including nodes being able to trust other nodes,
 preventing malicious nodes from doing bad things to the P2P network 
or the individual nodes, being able to send and receive data anonymously.
